# Weekly Challenge #8 - Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that plays the game of [ultimate tic tac toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe), a variant of tic tac toe where you play 9 smaller games to beat a larger meta game.** The idea of this challenge is to play around writing a bot for a game which rules are simple to write but hard to master.
